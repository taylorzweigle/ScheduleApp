# Schedule App

Web app using React, MongoDb, Express, NodeJS, and Tailwind CSS to create and manage events in a calendar timeline view.

The app allows for navigating to the previous and next weeks using arrow buttons and a today button to jump to the current date. A month picker also allows for quick navigation to a specific date in a month. Clicking an event will show event details and allow for the edit and deletion of that event.
